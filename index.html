    <p>
        I always loved visiting parks. My recent trip is truly unforgettable. The landscape was dominated by different features like different species of both animals and plants, geysers, mountains, lakes. It has a well-maintained hiking pathways, well this is because a lot of people visit this park. At some point you might even think you just entered a different country because the park offers a perfect blend of stunning natural beauty and adventure.
